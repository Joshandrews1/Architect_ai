# Design Prompt for a High-Tech Infographic Poster

## 1. Core Concept & Subject

A visually striking, futuristic digital infographic poster summarizing the key findings on "The Global Shift to AI Education in 2026". The final output should look like a polished, high-fidelity presentation slide from a cutting-edge tech company.

## 2. Style & Atmosphere

*   **Overall Aesthetic:** Dark mode, tech-noir, cyberpunk-lite. It should feel professional, clean, and data-driven, but with a futuristic and slightly glowing digital feel.
*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Background:** A dark, deep space-blue (`#001f3f`) transitioning into near-black (`#020202`).
    *   **Primary Accent:** A vibrant, glowing "cyber yellow" (`#ffff00`). This is used for titles, icons, and key highlights.
    *   **Text:** Main text is crisp white. Secondary or descriptive text is a semi-transparent white or light gray (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)`).
*   **Typography:** A clean, modern sans-serif or mono-spaced font (similar to Space Grotesk).
    *   **Headings:** Bold, uppercase, and often in cyber yellow.
    *   **Body Text:** Regular weight, in white or light gray.

## 3. Layout & Composition (A4 Vertical Poster)

The infographic should be structured into clear, distinct sections from top to bottom.

### **Section 1: Main Title Block (Top)**
*   **Main Title:** Large, bold, uppercase text in **cyber yellow**. The text should read: **"AI IN EDUCATION: 2026"**.
*   **Subtitle:** Directly below the main title, a single sentence in clean white text. The text should read: **"A global shift towards hyper-personalized learning."**

### **Section 2: Key Data Points (Middle)**
*   This section features three distinct "data pods" arranged horizontally. Each pod should be visually separated.
*   **Pod 1: User Growth**
    *   **Icon:** A simple, glowing **cyber yellow** `BarChart` icon inside a circular container with a thin yellow border.
    *   **Title:** A short, bold white title: **"DAILY ADOPTION"**.
    *   **Description:** A concise sentence in light gray text: **"40% of students now use AI tutors daily, up from 15%."**
*   **Pod 2: Efficiency Gains**
    *   **Icon:** A simple, glowing **cyber yellow** `Shield` icon inside a circular container.
    *   **Title:** A short, bold white title: **"LEARNING EFFICIENCY"**.
    *   **Description:** A concise sentence in light gray text: **"Study time reduced by 30% while retention rose by 12%."**
*   **Pod 3: Top Tools**
    *   **Icon:** A simple, glowing **cyber yellow** `Users` icon inside a circular container.
    *   **Title:** A short, bold white title: **"LEADING TOOLS"**.
    *   **Description:** A concise sentence in light gray text: **"Personalized Quizzing, Live Translation, and Skill-Gap Analysis."**

### **Section 3: Summary Box (Bottom)**
*   A rounded rectangle with a semi-transparent black background and a thin, subtle white border.
*   **Title:** Inside the box, a **cyber yellow** title: **"In Summary"**.
*   **Content:** A paragraph summarizing the key takeaways in light gray text. The text should read: **"The educational landscape is rapidly integrating AI, leading to significant user adoption and measurable efficiency gains. North America and East Asia are pioneering investment, focusing on adaptive, personalized tools that are reshaping how students learn."**

## 4. Final Polish & Details

*   Ensure all text is highly legible against the dark background.
*   The "cyber yellow" elements should have a subtle glow effect to make them pop.
*   The overall composition should feel balanced, organized, and easy to read at a glance.
*   Avoid clutter. The design should be minimalist yet impactful.
